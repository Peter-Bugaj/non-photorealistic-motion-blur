This project requires a java compiler and has a GUI interface that can be best executed
running eclipse (www.eclipse.org/).

1.  Downloading required libraries:

    Download gluegen-[version-x].dll, gluegen-[version-x].jar, jogl-[version-x].dll and
    jogl-[version-x].jar (for Windows) to allow the open GL libraries to run in Java.
    
    See setup for JOGL for more info:
    (http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL)


    Download the common-codex.jar file from (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/download_codec.cgi)

    Add the downloaded libraries to the non-photorealistic-motion-blur/lib folder of your
    installation directory.
    Also, once setup on eclipse, include these files in your classpath during the execution process.
    
    
    NOTE: The above libraries work for Windows. Operating systems may differ.
    Once again, see (http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL) for
    properly installing JOGL on your computer.



2.  Downloaded the data for 3D meshes:

    Download the mesh data from (http://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/data.html)
    and add it to your non-photorealistic-motion-blur/model folder of your installation directory.
    
    The data files should have the following organized directory structure:
	
	horse-poses     | Horse poses from Figure 1.
	horse-gallop    | Horse gallop animation from the video.
	horse-collapse  | Horse collapse animation from Figure 6 and the video.
	camel-poses     | Camel poses from Figure 1.
	camel-gallop    | Camel gallop animation from the video.
	camel-collapse  | Camel collapse animation from Figure 6 and the video.
	cat-poses       | Cat poses from Figure 5.
	lion-poses      | Lion poses from Figure 5.
	face-poses      | Face mask expressions from Figure 7.
	head-poses      | Head expressions from Figure 7.
	flamingo-poses  | Flamingo poses from Figure 8.
	elephant-poses  | Elephant poses shown at SIGGRAPH 2004.
	elephant-gallop | Elephant gallop animation, shown at SIGGRAPH 2004.

    With each mesh file triangulated and in .obj format.
  

  
3.  Create a meta.properties inside the non-photorealistic-motion-blur/model folder
    and paste the following information:

      modelLocation = models/horse-gallop/horse-gallop
      modelName = horse-gallop
      totalFiles = 48

    This data can be changed but it basically tells the program what data to use when
    it runs. For example, each time the GUI is ran, the software will load the mesh
    data from the /horse-gallop/horse-gallop directory, where it will find the 
    data obj files prefixed with the name horse-gallop, and that the number of files
    it is expecting to find for the animation is 48.

    Change horse-gallop to what ever other model you want to use, provided it
    follows this format.



4.  Running the software:

    Once setup in eclipse, the software should be easily executable. Visit src/main/GUI.java
    using your eclipse browser and click run. This should bring up the interface with
    the correct mesh data loaded.
